use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;
use App\Http\Controllers\EmployeeController;
use App\Http\Controllers\BossController;
use App\Http\Controllers\StakeholderController;
use App\Http\Controllers\LocationController;
use App\Http\Controllers\ClearanceFormController;
use App\Http\Controllers\ClearanceFormApprovalController;
use App\Http\Controllers\EmployeeLocationController;
use App\Http\Controllers\StakeholderLocationController;

Route::resource('employees', EmployeeController::class);
Route::resource('bosses', BossController::class);
Route::resource('stakeholders', StakeholderController::class);
Route::resource('locations', LocationController::class);
Route::resource('clearanceForms', ClearanceFormController::class);
Route::resource('clearanceFormApprovals', ClearanceFormApprovalController::class);
Route::resource('employeeLocations', EmployeeLocationController::class);
Route::resource('stakeholderLocations', StakeholderLocationController::class);

Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});
This file defines the following routes:

employees resource route, handled by EmployeeController
bosses resource route, handled by BossController
stakeholders resource route, handled by StakeholderController
locations resource route, handled by LocationController
clearanceForms resource route, handled by ClearanceFormController
clearanceFormApprovals resource route, handled by ClearanceFormApprovalController
employeeLocations resource route, handled by EmployeeLocationController
stakeholderLocations resource route, handled by StakeholderLocationController
Each resource route defines the standard CRUD operations:

GET /{resource} - index
GET /{resource}/create - create
POST /{resource} - store
GET /{resource}/{id} - show
GET /{resource}/{id}/edit - edit
PUT /{resource}/{id} - update
DELETE /{resource}/{id} - destroy
Note that you may need to adjust the route names and controller methods to fit your specific application requirements.
